/*
 * How the transport fits into the system
 * ======================================
 *
 * AllJoyn provides the concept of a Transport which provides a relatively
 * abstract way for the daemon to use different network mechanisms for getting
 * Messages from place to another.  Conceptually, think of, for example, a Unix
 * transport that moves bits using unix domain sockets, a Bluetooth transport
 * that moves bits over a Bluetooth link, or a TCP transport that moves Messages
 * over a TCP connection.  A UDP transport moves Messages over UDP datagrams
 * using a reliability layer.
 *
 * BSD sockets is oriented toward clients and servers.  There are different
 * sockets calls required for a program implementing a server-side part and a
 * client side part.  The server-side listens for incoming connection requests
 * and the client-side initiates the requests.  AllJoyn clients are bus
 * attachments that our Applications may use and these can only initiate
 * connection requests to AllJoyn daemons.  Although dameons may at first blush
 * appear as the service side of a typical BSD sockets client-server pair, it
 * turns out that while daemons obviously must listen for incoming connections,
 * they also must be able to initiate connection requests to other daemons.
 * This explains the presence of both connect-like methods and listen-like
 * methods here.
 *
 * A fundamental idiom in the AllJoyn system is that of a thread.  Active
 * objects in the system that have threads wandering through them will implement
 * Start(), Stop() and Join() methods.  These methods work together to manage
 * the autonomous activities that can happen in a UDPTransport.  These
 * activities are carried out by so-called hardware threads.  POSIX defines
 * functions used to control hardware threads, which it calls pthreads.  Many
 * threading packages use similar constructs.
 *
 * In a threading package, a start method asks the underlying system to arrange
 * for the start of thread execution.  Threads are not necessarily running when
 * the start method returns, but they are being *started*.  Some time later, a
 * thread of execution appears in a thread run function, at which point the
 * thread is considered *running*.  In the case of the UDPTransport, the Start()
 * method spins up a thread to run the basic maintenance operations such as
 * deciding when to listen and advertise.  Another thread(s) is started to deal
 * with handling callbacks for deadlock avoidance.  The AllJoyn daemon is a
 * fundamentally multithreaded environemnt, so multiple threads may be trying to
 * connect, disconnect, and write from the daemon side, and at the same time
 * connect, disconnect, read and write callbacks may be coming from the network
 * side.  This means that as soon as UDPTransport::Start() is executed, multiple
 * threads, originating both in the transport and from outside, may be wandering
 * around in objects used by the tansport; and so one must be very careful about
 * resource management.  This is the source of much of the complexity in this
 * module.
 *
 * In generic threads packages, executing a stop method asks the underlying
 * system to arrange for a thread to end its execution.  The system typically
 * sends a message to the thread to ask it to stop doing what it is doing.  The
 * thread is running until it responds to the stop message, at which time the
 * run method exits and the thread is considered *stopping*.  The UDPTransport
 * provides a Stop() method to do exactly that.  Note that neither of Start()
 * nor Stop() are synchronous in the sense that one has actually accomplished
 * the desired effect upon the return from a call.  Of particular interest is
 * the fact that after a call to Stop(), threads will still be *running* for
 * some non-deterministic time.  In order to wait until all of the threads have
 * actually stopped, a blocking call is required.  In threading packages this is
 * typically called join, and our corresponding method is called Join().  A user
 * of the UDPTransport must assume that immediately after a call to Start() is
 * begun, and until a call to Join() returns, there may be threads of execution
 * wandering anywhere in the transport and in any callback registered by the
 * caller.  The same model applies to connection endpoints (_UDPEndpoint)
 * instances.  Further complicating _UDPEndpoint design is that the thread
 * lifetime methods may be called repeatedly or never (in the case of some forms
 * of timeout); and so the transport needs to ensure that all combinations of
 * these state transitions occur in an orderly and deterministic manner.
 *
 * The high-level process regarding how an advertisement translates into a
 * transport Connect() is a bit opaque, so we paint a high-level picture here.
 * First, a service (that will be *handling* RPC calls and *emitting* signals)
 * acquires a name on the bus, binds a session port and calls AdvertiseName.
 * This filters down (possibly through language bindings) to the AllJoyn Object.
 * The AllJoynObj essentially turns a DBus into an AllJoyn bus.  The AllJoyn
 * Object consults the transports on the transport list (the UDP transport is
 * one of those) and eventually sends an advertisement request to each specified
 * transport by calling each transport's EnableAdvertisement() method.  We
 * transnslate this call to a call to the the IpNameService::AdvertiseName()
 * method we call since we are an IP-based transport.  The IP name service will
 * multicast the advertisements to other daemons listening on our device's
 * connected networks.
 *
 * A client that is interested in using the service calls the discovery
 * method FindAdvertisedName.  This filters down (possibly through
 * language bindings) to the AllJoyn object, into the transports on the
 * transport list (us) and we eventually call IpNameService::FindAdvertisedName()
 * since we are an IP-based transport.  The IP name service multicasts the
 * discovery message to other daemons listening on our networks.
 *
 * The daemon remembers which clients have expressed interest in which services,
 * and expects name services to call back with the bus addresses of daemons they
 * find which have the associated services.  When a new advertisement is
 * received, the name service fires a callback into the transport, and it, in turn, calls
 * into its associated BusListener to pass the information back to the daemon.
 *
 * The callback includes information about the discovered name, the IP address,
 * port and daemon GUID of the remote daemon (now Routing Node).  This bus
 * address is "hidden" from interested clients and replaced with a more generic
 * name and TransportMask bit (for us it will be TRANSPORT_UDP).  The client
 * either responds by (1) ignoring the advertisement; (2) waiting to accumulate
 * more answers to see what the options are; or (3) joins a session to the
 * implied daemon/service.  A reference to a SessionOpts object is provided as a
 * parameter to a JoinSession call if the client wants to connect.  This
 * SessionOpts reference is passed down into the transport (selected by the
 * TransportMask) into the Connect() method which is used to establish the
 * connection and can be used to determine if the discovered name posesses
 * certain desired characteristics (to aid in determine the course of action
 * of the client
 *
 * There are four basic connection mechanisms that are described by the options.
 * These can be viewed as a matrix;
 *
 *                                                      IPv4               IPv6
 *                                                 ---------------    ---------------
 *     TRAFFIC MESSAGES | TRAFFIC_RAW_RELIABLE  |   Reliable IPv4      Reliable IPv6
 *     TRAFFIC_RAW_UNRELIABLE                   |  Unreliable IPv4    Unreliable IPv6
 *
 * Note that although the UDP protocol is unreliable, the AllJoyn Reliable Datagram
 * Protocol is an additional reliability layer, so that TRAFFIC_MESSAGES are actually
 * sent over the UDP protocol.

 * The bits in the provided SessionOpts select the row, but the column is left
 * free (unspecified).  This means that it is up to the transport to figure out
 * which one to use.  Clearly, if only one of the two address flavors is
 * possible (known from examining the returned bus address which is called a
 * connect spec in the Connect() method) the transport should choose that one.
 * If both IPv4 or IPv6 are available, it is up to the transport (again, us) to
 * choose the "best" method since we don't bother clients with that level of
 * detail.
 *
 * Perhaps somewhat counter-intuitively, advertisements relating to the UDP
 * Transport use the u4addr (unreliable IPv4 address), u4port (unreliable IPv4
 * port), u6addr (unreliable IPv6 address), and u6port (unreliable IPv6 port).
 * At the same time, the UDP Transport tells clients of the transport that it
 * supports TRAFFIC MESSAGES only.  This is because the underlying network
 * protocol used is UDP which is inherently unreliable.  We provide a
 * reliability layer to translate the unreliable UDP4 and UDP6 datagrams into
 * reliable AllJoyn messages.  The UDP Transpot does not provide RAW sockets
 * which is a deprecated traffic type.
 *
 * Internals
 * =========
 *
 * We spend a lot of time on the threading aspects of the transport since they
 * are often the hardest part to get right and are complicated.  This is where
 * the bugs live.
 *
 * As mentioned above, the AllJoyn system uses the concept of a Transport.  You
 * are looking at the UDPTransport.  Each transport also has the concept of an
 * Endpoint.  The most important function fo an endpoint is to provide (usually)
 * non-blocking semantics to higher level code.  If the source thread overruns
 * the ability of the transport to move bits (reliably), we must apply
 * back-pressure by blocking the calling thread, but usually a call to PushBytes
 * results in an immediate UDP datagram sendto.  In the UDP transport there are
 * separate worker threads assigned to reading UDP datagrams, running the
 * reliability layer and dispatching received AllJoyn messages.
 *
 * Endpoints are specialized into the LocalEndpoint and the RemoteEndpoint
 * classes.  LocalEndpoint represents a connection from a router to the local
 * bus attachment or daemon (within the "current" process).  A RemoteEndpoint
 * represents a connection from a router to a remote attachment or daemon.  By
 * definition, the UDPTransport provides RemoteEndpoint functionality.
 *
 * RemoteEndpoints are further specialized according to the flavor of the
 * corresponding transport, and so you will see a UDPEndpoint class defined
 * below which provides functionality to send messages from the local router to
 * a destination off of the local process using a UDP transport mechanism.
 *
 * RemoteEndpoints use AllJoyn stream objects to actually move bits.  In UDP
 * this is a bit of an oxymoron, however an AllJoyn stream is a thin layer on
 * top of a Socket (which is another thin layer on top of a BSD socket) that
 * provides a PushBytes() method.  Although UDP is not a stream-based protocol,
 * we treat each received datagram as a separate stream for the purposes of
 * passing back to the AllJoyn core which expectes to be able to read bytes from
 * a message backing object.
 *
 * Unlike a TCP transport, there are no dedicated receive threads.  Receive
 * operations in UDP are not associted with a particular endpoint at all, other
 * than using the required endpoint as a convencient place holder for a
 * connection data structure.  The UDP Transport operates more in an
 * Asynchronous IO-like fashion.  Received datagrams appear out of the ARDP
 * protocol as callbacks and are sent into a callback dispatcher thread.  Once
 * the dispatcher has an inbound datagram(s) it reassembles and unmarshals the
 * datagrams into an AllJoyn Message.  It then calls into the daemon
 * (PushMessage) to arrange for delivery.  A separate thread runs the
 * maintenance aspects of the UDP reliability layer (to drive retransmissions,
 * timeouts, etc.) and the endpoint management code (to drive the lifetime state
 * transitions of endpoints).
 *
 * The UDPEndpoint inherits some infrastructure from the more generic
 * RemoteEndpoint class.  Since the UDP transport is a not a stream-based
 * protocol, it does redefine some of the basic operation of the RemoteEndpoint
 * to suit its needs.  The RemoteEndpoint is also somewhat bound to the concept
 * of stream and receive thread, so we have to jump through some hoops to
 * coexist.
 *
 * The UDP endpoint does not use SASL for authentication and implements required
 * dameon exchanges in the SYN, SYN + ACK echanges of the underlying ARDP
 * protocol.  Although there is no authentication, per se, we still call this
 * handshake phase authentication since the BusHello is part of the
 * authentication phase of the TCP Transport.  Authentication can, of course,
 * succeed or fail based on timely interaction between the two sides, but it can
 * also be abused in a denial of service attack.  If a client simply starts the
 * process but never responds, it could tie up a daemon's resources, and
 * coordinated action could bring down a daemon.  Because of this, we provide a
 * way to reach in and abort authentications that are "taking too long" and free
 * the associated resources.
 *
 * As described above, a daemon can listen for inbound connections and it can
 * initiate connections to remote daemons.  Authentication must happen in both
 * cases and so we need to worry about denial of service in both directions and
 * recover gracefully.
 *
 * When the daemon is brought up, its TransportList is Start()ed.  The transport
 * specs string (e.g., "unix:abstract=alljoyn;udp:;tcp:;bluetooth:") is provided
 * to TransportList::Start() as a parameter.  The transport specs string is
 * parsed and in the example above, results in "unix" transports, "tcp"
 * transports, "udp" transports and "bluetooth" transports being instantiated
 * and started.  As mentioned previously "udp:" in the daemon translates into
 * UDPTransport.  Once the desired transports are instantiated, each is
 * Start()ed in turn.  In the case of the UDPTransport, this will start the
 * maintenance loop.  Initially there are no sockets to listen on.
 *
 * The daemon then needs to start listening on inbound addresses and ports.
 * This is done by the StartListen() command.  This also takes the same kind of
 * server args string shown above but this time the address and port information
 * are used.  For example, one might use the string
 * "udp:u4addr=0.0.0.0,u4port=9955;" to specify which address and port to listen
 * to.  This Bus::StartListen() call is translated into a transport
 * StartListen() call which is provided with the string described above, which
 * we call a "listen spec".  Our UDPTransport::StartListen() will arange to
 * create a Socket, bind the socket to the address and port provided and save
 * the new socket on a list of "listenFds" (we may listen on separate sockets
 * corresponding to multiple network interfaces).  Another of the many
 * complications we have to deal with is that the Android Compatibility Test
 * Suite (CTS) requires that an idle phone not have any sockets listening for
 * inbound data.  In order to pass the CTS in the case of the pre-installed
 * daemon, we must only have open name service sockets when actively advertising
 * or discovering.  This implies that we need to track the adveritsement state
 * and enable or disable the name service depending on that state.
 *
 * An inbound connection request in the UDP transport is consists of receiving a
 * SYN datagram.  The AcceptCb() is called from the reliability layer (on
 * reception of a SYN packet) in order to ask whether or not the connection
 * should be accepted.  If AcceptCb() determines there are enough resources for
 * a new connection it will call ARDP_Accept to provide a BusHello reply and
 * return true indicating acceptance, or false which means rejection.  If the
 * connection is accepted, a ConnectCb() is fired and the callback dispatcher
 * thread will ultimately handle the incoming request and create a UDPEndpoint
 * for the *proposed* new connection.
 *
 * Recall that an endpoint is not brought up immediately, but an authentication
 * step must be performed.  The required information (BusHello reply) is
 * provided back in the SYN + ACK packet.  The final ACK of the three-way
 * handshake completes the inbound connection establishment process.
 * If the authentication takes "too long" we assume that a denial of service
 * attack in in progress.  We fail such partial connections and the endpoint
 * management code removes them.
 *
 * A daemon transport can accept incoming connections, and it can make outgoing
 * connections to another daemon.  This case is simpler than the accept case
 * since it is expected that a socket connect can block higner level code, so it
 * is possible to do authentication in the context of the thread calling
 * Connect().  Connect() is provided a so-called "connect spec" which provides
 * an IP address ("u4addr=xxxx"), port ("y4port=yyyy") in a String.  A check is
 * always made to catch an attempt for the daemon to connect to itself which is
 * a system-defined error (it causes the daemon grief, so we avoid it here by
 * looking to see if one of the listenFds is listening on an interface that
 * corresponds to the address in the connect spec).  If the connect is allowed,
 * ee kick off a process in the underlying UDP reliability layer that
 * corresponds to the 3-way handshake of TCP.
 *
 * Shutting the UDPTransport down involves orchestrating the orderly termination
 * of:
 *
 *   1) Threads that may be running in the maintenance loop with associated Events
 *      and their dependent socketFds stored in the listenFds list;
 *   3) The callback dispatcher thread that may be out wandering around in the
 *      daemon doing its work;
 *   2) Threads that may be running around in endpoints and streams trying to write
 *      Mesages to the network.
 *
 * We have to be careful to follow the AllJoyn threading model transitions in
 * both the UDPTransport and all of its associated _UdpEndpoints.  There are
 * reference counts of endpoints to be respected as well.  In order to ensure
 * orderly termination of endoints and deterministic disposition of threads
 * which may be executing in those endpoints, We want the last reference count
 * held on an endpoint to be the one held by the transport.  There is much
 * work (see IncrementAndFetch, DecrementAndFetch, ManagedObj for example)
 * done to ensure this outcome.
 *
 * There are a lot of very carefully managed relationships here, so be careful
 * when making changes to the thread and resource management aspects of any
 * transport.  Taking lock order lightly is a recipe for disaster.  Always
 * consider what locks are taken where and in what order.  It's quite easy to
 * shoot yourself in multiple feet you never knew you had if you make an unwise
 * modification, and this can sometimes result in tiny little time-bombs set to
 * go off in seemingly completely unrelated code.
 *
 * A note on connection establishment
 * ==================================
 *
 * In the TCP transport, a separate synchronous sequence is executed before
 * AllJoyn messages can begin flowing.  First a NUL byte is sent as is required
 * in the DBus spec.  In order to get a destination address for the BusHello
 * message, the local side relies on the SASL three-way handshake exchange:
 *
 *     SYN ------------>
 *                       <- SYN + ACK
 *     ACK ------------>
 *     NUL ------------>
 *     AUTH ANONYMOUS ->
 *                       <- OK <GUID>
 *     BEGIN ---------->
 *
 * Once this is done, the active connector sends a BusHello Message and the
 * passive side sends a response
 *
 *     BusHello ------->
 *                       <- BusHello reply
 *
 * In the UDP Transport, we get rid of basically the whole Authentication
 * process and exchange required information in the SYN, SYN + ACK and
 * ACK packets of the protocol three-way handshake.
 *
 * The initial ARDP SYN packet *implies* AUTH_ANONYMOUS and contains the
 * BusHello message data from the Local (initiating/active) side of the
 * connection.  The SYN + ACK segment in response from the remote side contains
 * the response to the BusHello that was sent in the SYN packet.
 *
 *     SYN + BusHello -->
 *                        <- SYN + ACK + BusHello Reply
 *     ACK ------------->
 *
 * This all happens in a TCP-like SYN, SYN + ACK, ACK exchange with AllJoyn
 * data.  At the reception of the final ACK, the connection is up and running.
 *
 * This exchange is implemented using a number of callback functions that
 * fire on the local (active) and remote (passive) side of the connection.
 *
 * 1) The actively connecting side provides a BusHello message in call to
 *    ARDP_Connect().  As described above, ARDP provides this message as data in
 *    the SYN segment which is the first part of the three-way handshake;
 *
 * 2) When the passive side receives the SYN segment, its AcceptCb() callback is
 *    fired.  The data provided in the accept callback contains the BusHello
 *    message from the actively opening side.  The passive side, if it chooses
 *    to accept the connection, makes a call to ARDP_Accept() with its reply to
 *    the BusHello from the active side as data.  ARDP provides this data back
 *    in the SYN + ACK segment as the second part of its three-way handshake;
 *
 * 3) The actively connecting side receives a ConnectCb() callback as a result
 *    of the SYN + ACK coming back from the passive side.  This indicates that
 *    the newly established connection is going into the OPEN state from the
 *    local side's (ARDP) perspective.  Prior to firing the callback, ARDP
 *    automatically sends the final ACK and completes the three-way handshake.
 *    The ConectCb() with the active indication means that a SYN + ACK has been
 *    received that includes the reply to the original BusHello message.
 *
 * 4) When the final ACK of the three-way handshake is delivered to the passive
 *    opener side, it transitions the passive side to the OPEN state and fires
 *    a ConnectCb() callback with the passive indication meaning that the final
 *    ACK of the three-way handhake has arrived.
 *
 * From the perspective of the UDP Transport, this translates into the following
 * sequence diagram that reflects the three-way handshake that is going on under
 * the whole thing.
 *
 *                  Active Side                          Passive Side
 *                  ===========                          ============
 *      ARDP_Connect([out]BusHello message) --> AcceptCb([in]BusHello message) -----+
 *                                                                                  |
 * +--- ConnectCb([in]BusHello reply) <-------- ARDP_Accept([out]BusHello reply) <--+
 * |

     * soon as the call returns, the router expects to be able to delete the
     * message backing buffer (our buf) and go on about its business.
     *
     * That means we basically have to do the same thing here unless we start
     * ripping the guts out of the system.  That means the daemon router expects
     * to see and endpoint with a stream in it that has this PushBytes method.
     *
     * we need to copy the data in and return immediately if there is no
     * backpressure from the protocol; or copy the data in and block the caller
     * if there is backpressure.  Backpressure is indicated by the
     * ER_ARDP_BACKPRESSURE return.  If this happens, we cannot send any more
     * data until we get a send callback indicating the other side has consumed
     * some data.  In this case we need to block the calling thread until it can
     * continue.
     *
     * TODO: Note that the blocking is on an endpoint-by-endpoint basis, which
     * means there is a write event per endpoint.  This could be changed to one
     * event per transport, but would mean waking all blocked threads only to
     * have one of them succeed and the rest go back to sleep if the event
     * wasn't directed at them.  This is the classic thundering herd, but trades
     * CPU for event resources which may be a good way to go since our events
     * can be so expensive.  It's a simple change conceptually but there is no
     * bradcast condition variable in common, which would be the way to go.
     *
     * For now, we will take the one event per endpoint approach and optimize
     * that as time permits.
     *
     * When a buffer is sent, the ARDP protocol takes ownership of it until it
     * is ACKed by the other side or it times out.  When the ACK happens, a send
     * callback is fired that will record the actual status of the send and free
     * the buffer.  The status of the write is not known until the next read or

     * based on the stream in that endpoint.  The lock order here is
     * endpointListLock, then ardpLock.  It is also equally common for the main
     * thread to take the ardpLock and then call into ARDP_Run(), which can call
     * out into a callback.  Those callbacks then want to take the
     * enpointListLock to figure out how to deal with the callback.  The lock
     * order there is ardpLock, then endpointListLock.
     *
     * We usually get around that problem by dispatching all callbacks on the
     * dispatcher thread which can also use the endpointListLock, then ardpLock
     * lock order just like external threads.
     *
     * The problem here is that AcceptCb() needs to return a boolean indicating
     * whether or not it can accept a connection, and this depends on the number
     * of endpoints.  In order to look at the size of the lists of endpoints,
     * you need to take the endpoint list lock, which would result in a
     * potential deadlock.  Also, if we create an endpoint, we need to take the
     * endpointListLock in order to add it to the auth list.  In other words, we
     * must take the endpoint list lock, but we cannot take the endpoint list
     * lock.
     *
     * To work around the number of available endpoints issue, we keep an
     * atomically incremented and decremented number of available endpoints
     * around so we don't have to take a lock and call a size() method on a
     * couple of lists, as the TCP Transport would.  To work around the second
     * problem we do the addition of the new endpoint to a "pre" queue protected
     * by a third lock that must never held while either holding or taking the
     * ARDP lock (which is held here since we are in a callback).
     *
     * Bringing up a connection means transiently adding a connection to the
     * count of currently authenticating connections.  This number is never
     * allowed to exceed a configured value.  The number of authenticating plus

 * which fails systems that have processes listening for UDP connections when
 * the test is run.
 *
 * Listeners and advertisements are interrelated.  In order to Advertise a
 * service, the name service must have an endpoint to include in its
 * advertisements; and there must be at least one listener running and ready to
 * receive connections before telling the name service to advertise.
 *
 * Discovery requests do not require listeners be present per se before being
 * forwarded to the name service.  A discovery request will ulitmately lead to a
 * bus-to-bus connection once a remote daemon has been discovered; but the local
 * side will always start the connection.  Sessions throw a bit of a monkey
 * wrench in the works, though.  Since a JoinSession request is sent to the
 * (already connected) remote daemon and it decides what to do, we don't want to
 * arbitrarily constrain the remote daemon by disallowing it to try and connect
 * back to the local daemon.  For this reason, we do require listeners to be
 * present before discovery starts.
 *
 * So the goal is to not have active listeners in the system unless there are
 * outstanding advertisements or discovery requests, but we cannot have
 * outstanding advertisements or discovery requests until there are active
 * listeners.  Some care is obviously required here to accomplish this
 * seemingly inconsistent behavior.
 *
 * We call the state of no outstanding advertisements and not outstanding
 * discovery requests "Name Service Quiescent".  In this case, the name service
 * must be disabled so that it doesn't interact with the network and cause a CTS
 * failure.  As soon as a either a discovery request or an advertisement request
 * is started, we need to enable the name service to recieve and send network
 * packets, which will cause the daemon process to begin listening on the name
 * service well-known UDP port.
 *
 * Before an advertisement or a discovery request can acutally be sent over the
 * wire, we must start a listener which will receive connection requests, and
 * we must provide the name service with endpoint information that it can include
 * in its advertisement.  So, from the name service and network perspective,
 * listens must preceed advertisements.
 *
 * In order to accomplish the CTS requirements, however, advertisements must
 * preceed listens.  It turns out that this is how the high-level system wants
 * to work.  Essentually, the system calls StartListen at the beginning of time
 * (when the daemon is first brought up) and it calls StopListen at the end of
 * time (when the daemon is going down).  Advertisements and discovery requests
 * come and go in between as clients and services come up and go down.
 *
 * To deal with this time-inversion, we save a list of all listen requests, a
 * list of all advertisement requests and a list of all discovery requests.  At
 * the beginning of time we get one or more StartListen calls and save the
 * listen specs, but do not actually do the socket operations to start the
 * corresponding socket-level listens.  When the first advertisement or
 * discovery request comes in from the higher-level code, we first start all of
 * the saved listens and then enable the name service and ask it to start
 * advertising or discovering as appropriate.  Further advertisements and
 * discovery requests are also saved, but the calls to the name service are
 * passed through when it is not quiescent.
 *
 * We keep track of the disable advertisement and discovery calls as well.  Each
 * time an advertisement or discover operation is disabled, we remove the
 * corresponding entry in the associated list.  As soon as all advertisements
 * and discovery operations are disabled, we disable the name service and remove
 * our UDP listeners, and therefore remove all listeners from the system.  Since
 * we have a saved a list of listeners, they can be restarted if another
 * advertisement or discovery request comes in.
 *
 * We need to do all of this in one place (here) to make it easy to keep the
 * state of the transport (us) and the name service consistent.  We are
 * basically a state machine handling the following transitions:
 *
 *   START_LISTEN_INSTANCE: An instance of a StartListen() has happened so we
 *     need to add the associated listen spec to our list of listeners and be
 *     ready for a subsequent advertisement.  We expect these to happen at the
 *     beginning of time; but there is nothing preventing a StartListen after we
 *     start advertising.  In this case we need to execute the start listen.
 *
 *   STOP_LISTEN_INSTANCE: An instance of a StopListen() has happened so we need
 *     to remove the listen spec from our list of listeners.  We expect these to
 *     happen at the end of time; but there is nothing preventing a StopListen
 *     at any other time.  In this case we need to execute the stop listen and
 *     remove the specified listener immediately
 *
 *   ENABLE_ADVERTISEMENT_INSTANCE: An instance of an EnableAdvertisement() has
 *     happened.  If there are no other ongoing advertisements, we need to
 *     enable the stored listeners, pass the endpoint information down to the
 *     name servcie, enable the name service communication with the outside
 *     world if it is disabled and finally pass the advertisement down to the
 *     name service.  If there are other ongoing advertisements we just pass
 *     down the new advertisement.  It is an AllJoyn system programming error to
 *     start advertising before starting at least one listen.
 *
 *   DISABLE_ADVERTISEMENT_INSTANCE: An instance of a DisableAdvertisement()
 *     call has happened.  We always want to pass the corresponding Cancel down
 *     to the name service.  If we decide that this is the last of our ongoing
 *     advertisements, we need to continue and disable the name service from
 *     talking to the outside world.  For completeness, we remove endpoint
 *     information from the name service.  Finally, we shut down our UDP
 *     transport listeners.
 *
 *   ENABLE_DISCOVERY_INSTANCE: An instance of an EnableDiscovery() has
 *     happened.  This is a fundamentally different request than an enable
 *     advertisement.  We don't need any listeners to be present in order to do
 *     discovery, but the name service must be enabled so it can send and
 *     receive WHO-HAS packets.  If the name service communications are
 *     disabled, we need to enable them.  In any case we pass the request down
 *     to the name service.
 *
 *   DISABLE_DISCOVERY_INSTANCE: An instance of a DisableDiscovery() call has
 *     happened.  There is no corresponding disable call in the name service,
 *     but we do have to decide if we want to disable the name service to keep
 *     it from listening.  We do so if this is the last discovery instance and
 *     there are no other advertisements.
 *
 * There are five member variables that reflect the state of the transport
 * and name service with respect to this code:
 *
 *   m_isListening:  The list of listeners is reflected by currently listening
 *     sockets.  We have network infrastructure in place to receive inbound
 *     connection requests.
 *
 *   m_isNsEnabled:  The name service is up and running and listening on its
 *     sockets for incoming requests.
 *
 *   m_isAdvertising: We are advertising at least one well-known name either actively or quietly .
 *     If we are m_isAdvertising then m_isNsEnabled must be true.
 *
 *   m_isDiscovering: The list of discovery requests has been sent to the name
 *     service.  If we are m_isDiscovering then m_isNsEnabled must be true.

         *
         * 4.  a.b.c.d   'specific'   Listen on a specified address and so
         *                            only respond to inbound connections on
         *                            that interface.  Only advertise and
         *                            discover over a specific named network
         *                            interface (presumably the same interface
         *                            but we don't require it to be set up yet).
         *                            This allows administrators to to limit
         *                            AllJoyn to both listening and advertising
         *                            and discovering only over a specific
         *                            network interface.  This requires that
         *                            the IP address of the network interface
         *                            named 'specific' to be known a-priori.
         *
         * Note that the string 'specific' from the ns_interfaces configuration
         * can also refer to a specific IP address and is not limited to only
         * network interface names.  Thus, if one has a statically configured
         * network address, one could specify both listening and advertisement
         * using IP addresses:
         *
         * 5.  a.b.c.d   'a.b.c.d'    Listen on a specified address and so
         *                            only respond to inbound connections on
         *                            that interface.  Only advertise and
         *                            discover over a specific IP address
         *                            (presumably the same address but we
         *                            don't require it to be set up yet).
         *                            Note that there may, in fact, be a list
         *                            of specific IP addresses, but there can
         *                            be only one listen addresses.  This is
         *                            a degenerate version of the a.b.c.d '*'
         *                            case from above since you can contemplate
         *                            adding all IP addresses in the list.
         *
         * This is much harder to describe than to implement; but the upshot is
         * that we listen on whatever IP address comes in with the listenSpec
         * and we enable the name service on whatever interface name or address
         * that comes in in ns_interfaces.  It is up to the person doing the
         * configuration to understand what he or she is trying to do and the
         * impact of choosing those values.
         *
         * So, the first order of business is to determine whether or not the
         * current ns_interfaces item is an IP address or is a network interface
         * name.  If setting an IPAddress with the current item works, it is an
         * IP Address, otherwise we assume it must be a network interface.  Once
